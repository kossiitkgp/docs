# KOSSprint

## What is KOSSprint?
- It's an internal event held to accelerate slowed-down work, where KOSS members sit together for 2-3 hours and work on KOSS projects, slides, documentation, etc. that need immediate attention.
- It boosts productivity and encourage discussion among KOSS members.

## When to conduct a KOSSprint?
Sprints can be done whenever a lot of coding work (or any other work) is pending.
eg:
  - For planning a workshop, all can work together to make slides and poster.
  - During KWOC, all can work together to update the frontend, backend, mailing, etc.

## Where can KOSSprint be conducted?
The place should have good internet connection, enough plug points, no time-related restrictions (as sprints are usually held around midnight).
