# Room Booking
Steps for room and AV (Audio Visual) cell booking for conducting workshops and other events.

## Steps for Room Booking
- Go to the Junior Executive, Academic Section (UG) (Mr. Shouvik Adhikari as of now) and get the form for room booking. [Here](../assets/room-booking-form.pdf) is a scan of the form.
- This form is only for room booking and not for AV support.
- Fill in the details necessary for booking a room. Date, time, and duration.
- Get the signature of a Professor and the HOD of the respective department as the booking is made in the professor's name (Approach professors at the earliest). CSE professors are easily approachable for this, so can reach them out.
- Submit this form back to the Jr. Executive, and they would reach back in a day or two for the payment.
- The Jr. Executive would give a draft to be paid at the fees counter and take the payment receipt.
- Upon submitting the receipt to the Jr. Executive, the process from our end is done.
- The Jr. Executive would email a memo with the permission to use the room to the professor approving the booking (and may add the person booking it in cc).
- This memo must be printed and shown to the guard with the keys. In the worst case, the email and pdf memo can be shown.
- Note that room booking must be done **7 days** prior to the day of the event and the booking procedure takes at least **4-5 days**.
- Support for mic and projector is booked separately at the [AV Cell](#steps-for-booking-av-audio-visual-cell).

### Room Booking During CDC
- When CDC internships and placements, all Nalanda classrooms and Vikramshila rooms are booked by the CDC.
- In order to conduct a workshop during this period, explicit written permission is required from CDC to use a particular room.
- This permission can only be obtained with the approval of a professor.
- If a professor agrees to approve the booking, they will have to send an email to CDC (`tnp-off@hijli.iitkgp.ac.in`) with us (`admin@kossiitkgp.org`) and `tpn-placecom@hijli.iitkgp.ac.in` in cc, asking for permission to conduct the event on our behalf.
- The permission will be emailed back and should be kept show to the guard on the day of the event.
- The [AV Cell booking](#steps-for-booking-av-audio-visual-cell) booking should be done separately throught the normal procedure. The permission email might be asked for during the AV cell booking process.

## Steps for booking AV (Audio Visual) Cell
- Get the AV cell "Requisition Form" from the AV cell control room in Nalanda (ground floor) or from the CWISS (Central Workshop & Instruments Service Section) office near the Mechanical Engineering department.
- The form may also be scanned and printed. [Here](../assets/av-cell-requisition-form.pdf) is a scan of the form.
- Fill in the required details and get it signed by a professor.
	- Preferrably, the student filling the form should be of the same department as the professor signing the form.
	- For `User Name with Cell No`, fill the name of the *student* filling the form and their phone number.
	- For `User designation with EC No. / Roll No`, fill just the roll number of the student.
	- For `Users' Deptt./Centre/Society`, fill "Kharagpur Open Source Society."
	- For `Equipments Required`, mention mic and speaker for audio and projector for screen sharing.
- The professor's seal must be stamped on the signed form from the respective department's office.
- Submit the form to the CWISS office or at the control room in Nalanda.

## Points to be noted
- Keep at least **2 weeks** in hand before booking a room, the process takes time. The booking must be done at least **7 days** prior to the day of the workshop and the procedure can take Weekends are excluded.
- AV Cell booking can be done 2-3 days in advance but it is still better to do it at the earliest along with room booking.
- UPI payment is accepted while paying in the Fees department.
- Both the form for room booking and AV cell needs the professor's signature, better to get it done together.
- Contact the AV Cell staff and AC maintainers of Nalanda one day before the event to notify them. [Here](../assets/av-cell-contacts.jpg) is a list of contacts.
