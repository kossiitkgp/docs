# Kharagpur Winter of Code 2022
## Student Manual
### Introduction
#### What is Kharagpur Winter of Code?
You have seen the [website](https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org) of KWoC, you have heard your friends talking about it, you have seen the posters all over the place and now you want to know more about it. That’s great! So, here we go:

Kharagpur Winter of Code is an initiative by Kharagpur Open Source Society ([KOSS](https://kossiitkgp.org)) for getting students having little to no experience in open source software development involved in Open Source contributions.

KWoC is modeled to be similar to but smaller in scope than [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org), [Season of KDE](https://season.kde.org), [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org), [GirlScript Summer of Code](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech). KWoC matches interested students with open source projects looking for contributions.

Students work through the winter to contribute code and documentation to the project(s). Through their work, students are exposed to open source culture and gain experience in software development and collaborative work. We, at KOSS, promote open source through this event every year.

**NOTE: KOSS does not provide any form of stipend to students taking part in KWoC. It is a program purely for learning purposes.**

Registered students will have to choose one or more projects from the list, which will be released on 6th December 2021. Every project list will have at least one mentor and an Ideas Page. The Ideas Page will contain the possible work to be done on the project. Students will then contact the mentor who shall guide them on the project and continue discussing their plan for the winter.

#### Goals of the program
The primary goals of KWoC are:
- Inspire young developers to get involved in Open Source software development.
- Help them to master the development workflow of Git and GitHub.
- Connect students with mentors.

### Why should I apply?
Well, now you know that Kharagpur Winter of Code seems like something productive to do this December. But why shouldn’t I just go on a trip? Well, here are some of the reasons why you should apply for it.

#### An absolutely amazing working experience on projects
KWoC is a place where you get to use your current skill set on existing projects. Working in collaboration with other people on an open source project is probably something new to you.

#### Acquiring new skill sets
While you’ll be adding your piece of code to the existing piece of software, you will get to learn the structure of the software and more about the process of creating it from scratch. That, in the future, will help you in creating your own software.

#### Building your network
While being a part of KWoC, you will have healthy conversations with many helpful and talented mentors. This will help you build your network in your early days itself. You can then approach them any time after the program ends. They remain with you, in your connections.

#### Sense of achievement
It feels really great to have your first patch submitted. It feels like an achievement when your contribution goes online and is ready to be helpful to other folks throughout the world.

#### For the love of code and open source
If you love to code and it relates even distinctly to your passion, then you will find an opportunity to express that love by being a part of the Kharagpur Winter of Code.

### Am I Good Enough?
In the past few years, a few first-year students from KGP have made their way to GSoC. If they can, this simply rules out myths like first years are not meant for it. The skills you need to be a part of it are:

#### Requirements:
##### Working setup
A working laptop/computer with internet throughout the program.
Most of the time, you will be coding and pushing your code online. This requires you to have a computer and a working internet connection with you.
Pro-Tip: Don’t be afraid if you don’t have a Linux operating system; your mentor is there to help you out!

##### Communication Skills
You will have to speak up. You will have to email the project mentor. You will have to submit your query to KOSS in case of any issue or facing difficulty in understanding anything. As long as you can express yourself, there is nothing to stop you from achieving it.

### How to apply?
#### Joining GitHub
Go to https://github.com and Sign Up. Choose a cool username (commonly referred to as GitHub handle) for yourself, and voila! You’re ready to dive into the world of open source!

#### Registration on KWoC website
Go to the website of KWoC - http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org and find the “Student Registration” button at the center of the page. Login with GitHub and fill in your name, email address and  Institute. Hoorah! You’re in (Hackerman.jpg).

### What to do next?
#### Choosing a project
First of all, choose the project(s) that you would like to work on in KWoC. You are free to contribute to as many projects as you like. Navigate over to https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/projects and hunt down projects by their description. All of the projects must be on GitHub. Learn how to get acquainted with GitHub’s interface with the help of various online resources, some of which are mentioned on the dashboards.

#### Making contact
The contact details of each mentor will be available to you on the projects list. Feel free to contact the mentors to know more about their project.

#### Software Development
Develop the project codebase. Write up test suites. Add third-party integrations. And lots of other cool stuff depending on your project. After cooking up the perfect recipe, use Git to keep track of the changes and create your Pull Requests.

GitHub. Fix as many issues as you can and add as many new features as possible to the project. Communicate with your mentor about further requirements and/or improvements

#### Writing documentation
The code that you have added must be documented thoroughly. Open Source involves writing code that humans can read and
understand. Good documentation makes it easier to understand the code. Hence, add information in README, in the comments of code, etc. Ask your mentor to help you out with it.

#### Asking Questions
More often than not, mentors find it difficult to answer vague questions and tend to ignore them, considering the student is not very interested (even if you are!). We have two great articles for you. Do give them a read:
- Stackoverflow’s [How do I ask good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- Eric S. Raymond’s [How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

### Wrapping up
#### Mid Evals
By 20th Dec 2021, you should have at least 1 commit in the project(s) you’re working on. In other words, it means you have made at least 1 meaningful contribution to the project.

#### Stats Board
The leader board, which displays all the activities by registered students in KOSS, is live at
http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/stats/student. It represents the activity board of every student registered in KWoC. KOSS monitors the Stats board and various sorting options are available (by commits being the default one).

#### Report Submission
At the end of the 5 weeks, you will have to create a report. Failing to do so, will not result in successful participation.
The report can be as descriptive as you want but must contain at least the following points:
- List of projects you worked on
- List of Pull Requests you created
- Summary of your work
- Learnings

### Contact
For any queries, write an email to admin@kossiitkgp.org or feel free to post on #queries channel of our Slack workspace
