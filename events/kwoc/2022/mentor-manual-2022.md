# Kharagpur Winter of Code 2022
## Mentor Manual

### Introduction
#### What is Kharagpur Winter of Code?
[Kharagpur Winter of Code](http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/) is an initiative by Kharagpur Open Source Society ([KOSS](http://kossiitkgp.org/)) for the students, who have little or no experience in open source software development, to get them involved during the winter vacations and break the ice of Open Source contributions. All of the work is going to be on [GitHub](https://github.com).

KWoC is modeled to be similar to but smaller in scope than [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org), [Season of KDE](https://season.kde.org), [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org), [GirlScript Summer of Code](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech) and many similar programs. KWoC similarly, is aimed at introducing new students to the area and helping them make PRs, in fact, a first for many of them, and also gaining confidence which will help them continue their open source journey.

#### Goals of the program
As a mentor, you must know that the primary goal of the program is to help new students to understand the paradigm of open source contribution and increase their expertise level on Git and GitHub.

#### Eligibility
There are five main criteria to be a mentor in KWoC:
1. You must have one or more projects on GitHub with merge access.
2. Your project(s) have more than two easy-to-fix and at least one moderate level issue.
3. You must have a dedicated public communication channel for each project, where all the conversations regarding the project will happen.
4. Your project must have a descriptive README.
5. KWoC organizers approve your project(s).

### Why should I apply?
#### Boost your project
Do you have a project which you had started months ago and now you don’t find time to add new features to it or fix small issues? - You can think of applying. For the students, it’s about the contributions. And for you, it’s about keeping your project alive and going strong!

#### Nurture your idea into reality
Do you have an idea in your mind about a small or significant utility and want to make it real this December?. You can lay the groundwork and use the help of interested students to convert your idea into reality.


### Applying
#### Create a communication channel for your project
All the conversations between the mentor and the students who are working on the project should be on a public channel. It could be a Google group, IRC channel, Slack/Gitter/Matrix channel or any other communication platform that allows a team to interact and work collaboratively. Make sure to add the link to this communication channel in the registration form!

#### Make the project descriptive and beginner friendly
- Every kick-ass project needs to have a kick-ass README file. Go ahead and add a beautiful and detailed README to your project so that beginners can find it easy to get started with your project.
- You may add an action plan and a good proposal about what you aim to finish up by the end of KWoC. This will help applicants see a larger picture of what they can try developing instead of just fixing a couple of issues. You can add this abstract to the README file or the description of your project on GitHub. This is optional; the acceptance of your project doesn’t depend on the action plan, although we believe it’ll be of great help to the participants.
