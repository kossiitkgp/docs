## First things first 

- KWoC is a month-long event, generally conducted in December.
- Registrations start at least a week before the coding period (more than a week is preferred).
- Coding period is generally 4 weeks long
- Mid evals are held around 2 weeks after start of the coding period.
- End evals are done after the coding period

## Pre-registration

- The following things should be ready (or updated) :-

  - Website with registration feature tested internally.
  - FAQs on the website
  - Student and Mentor Docs of KWoC. Make sure that the content of the doc is updated with the current rules of KWoC(especially rules like Mid Evals and End Evals criteria). If there are any new important changes, do mention them in the docs. 

- A dedicated slack workspace for KWoC. If the old one has reached the maximum free limit, create a new Slack workspace.
  
- Intro Seminar of KWoC should be conducted, a week before the registrations begin.

   

## Registration:

-  It is recommended to start the registrations in the first week of November. At maximum, the registrations should begin by third week of November. Please do not delay the registrations further.
- It is suggested that Student, Mentor and Project Registrations begin at the same time.  
- Release a Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn Post from KOSS account. The post should contain the following things:
  - Briefly about KWoC
  - Mentor and Student Docs' Links
  - Instructions to register
  - A KWoC workspace invite link. (Already existing one or New Slack workspace can be created)
-  Make sure to take database backups periodically.

## Complaints and Queries

It is suggested a group of dedicated people from KOSS handle complaints and queries through out KWoC. The responsibilities can be split shift wise - One group can handle complaints during the day and the other during the night. However, **please make sure that the queries are answered within 24 hours**. KOSS members should be active at the following places to answer queries and complaints

- Facebook Page of KOSS

- KWoC Slack workspace

- Mails received at admin@kossiitkgp.org

- A Github Repo for Technical complaints. For example refer [this](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/kwoc-bugs)

- Twitter and Linkedin of KOSS account

  Make sure to keep the FAQ page exhaustive and detailed. Update the FAQ page from regularly if new frequent queries come up. Along with answering the queries, it is a good idea to share the FAQ Page of KWoC, so that future queries can be addressed without need of contact. 

## Coding Period

- Sometimes due to serious reasons, participants(students or mentors) miss out the registration period. In such cases, collect the details from the participant and add their entry in the database manually.
- Make sure that the site is regularly up and working, especially the stats tables. A group of people should be vigilant in this matter.
- Make sure that the database backups are taken periodically. A script doing that job would be preferred. However, make sure to check at times that the script is indeed working.
- Any important changes or announcements(like informing in case of spam, changing Mid evals dates) are to be made on both website and via email.

## Mid Evals

- It is important to inform about the Mid evals and its criteria via email and KWoC website atleast 3 days before the Mid evaluation. 
- **Mid evals criteria**:
  - **KWoC 20 criteria**: Having atleast one commit before was the criteria for clearing Mid evals. If the mentor has been inactive and the PR remains unmerged. We asked the students to mail 
  - In the previous KWoCs, there was a form, which was to filled by mentors. However, to automate stuff the single commit criteria was implemented. 
  - You are encouraged to make changes in the Mid Eval criteria, but make sure that it is fair and is not too hard to clear. (Remember, KWoC is meant to encourage beginners)
- In case of serious emergencies, do not hesitate cancel mid evaluations. For example, in 2019 when there was a ban of internet in few states, the mid evals were cancelled. 
- In case, if any individual is unable to clear mid evals due to some genuine reasons, it should be considered.

## End evals

- **End evals criteria**:
  - Till KWoC 20, the end evals criteria was asking the students to write a blog that summarizes their work. And the students would be evaluated based on the blog.
  - The above criteria was made to make sure that no mentor would unfairly pass/fail a student as per his/her wish.
  - Feel free to come up with any other criteria for End evals, but make sure that no student should have an unfair advantage.
- If blog criteria is being followed
  - Make sure to inform the students atleast a week time after the coding period ends to write the blog
  - Inform the criteria for end evals via email. Examples of previous blogs should be given.
- If  a student was unable to submit his/her blog before the deadline due to some genuine reasons. Do consider it later, its a month long effort!
- **Evaluation of blogs**:
  - For evaluation, distribute the blogs among members of KOSS for evaluation
  - While evaluating, if a member finds some blog that doesn't seem to clear the end evals, make sure to cross verify the same with other members of KOSS
- It is good to inform the participants by what date, they might expect the results of KWoC after they have submitted their End evals Blog. 

## Certificates

- Along with the name of the participant, the certificate must contain the following links
  - Verification link: A link of certificate hosted on a Public repository of KOSS - [kossiitkgp/public-files](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/public-files)
  - Stats link: A link containing the Student's or the Project's stats respectively for a student or a Mentor.

- Move the website from `kwoc.kossiitkgp.org` to `kwoc{Y}.kossiitkgp.org` (e.g. `kwoc19.kossiitkgp.org` for KWoC19). Thereafter, the stats are hosted on the latter while the former is reused next year.

- The certificates must be hosted on the public files repo - [kossiitkgp/public-files](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/public-files)
- The certificates in PDF formats should be sent via mail to the participants.

## Miscellaneous

- Take an anonymous feedback about the proceedings of KWoC from participants(preferably after end evals blog has been submitted).

- Update [kossiitkgp/mistakes](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/mistakes) repo for sake of posterity based on feedback and other things that went wrong.
