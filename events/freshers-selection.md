# Freshers' Selection

## How do we recruit?

> This should be carefully re-evaluated every year. People change, along with the needs of KOSS.

Core parameters for hiring are

- Knowledge
- Will to Learn
- Will to Teach

The parameters are given equal weight.

### Screening Round

An online form is released with few questionnaires. We carefully go through their answers and invite potential candidates for a sit-in interview with the team. We do this to focus more on the interviews with the eligible candidates.

Questions on the form for screening round -

* Name
* Roll Number
* Email ID
* Phone
* Share with us your URLs (GitHub, portfolio, any projects, etc.)
* Do you have any achievements you want us to know?
* When did you start programming? What motivates you? Tell us your story.
* What are you learning these days?
* What other societies/clubs/fests are you a part of or you want to be? How long have you been there? What are your opinions about them?
* Write your skills (Languages, frameworks, design skills, etc.)
* Why do you want to join KOSS? What are your expectations?
* Enlist all of your interactions with the KOSS community over the year
* Any comments?

### Interview Round

We form a few panels consisting of 3-5 people. Each panel should have at least one advisor. The interviewers evaluate them during the conversation. If a candidate does not have any projects done so far, a task must be given to check code quality. The tasks are on spot or to be completed within 24 hours.

## Panel Discussion and the release of results

We all meet a few days after the interview round and discuss each potential candidate. A Physical meeting is required before finalizing the list of new members.

## Guidelines

* Have a physical meeting to discuss the selection of freshers every year.
* Make sure the form reaches all the freshers. Good marketing is recommended.
* Make the students comfortable during the interview. Freshers can get nervous and you may not get to know them completely.
* For on-spot tasks, judge by their effort.
* Give the interviewees an experience to remember. Talk politely and be curious in them.
* It is important that the panelists write detailed comments for every candidate after their interview. This helps in judging them later.
* Do not share the Sheets (responses, interview comments, etc.) with KOSS internet accounts. Maintain them on personal accounts. There is no need to archive them.
* Do not share Sheets with the link (use email addresses to add collaborators). Limit possibility of the new members viewing the sheets in the future.
* Do not discuss selections on public channels on Slack or Google Group.

### Red Flags

**What do we mean by Red Flags?**

> If you spot a red flag, you say No at the very moment. No second thoughts or arguments.
> The Red flags listed below do not mean they are bad qualities as a programmer or as a human being. They only mean that the person is not a cultural fit for KOSS.

* Mentions disinterest in Teaching.
* Mentions disinterest in Learning.
* No idea what Open Source is (little knowledge is not a red flag)
* Highly involved in Competitive programming (as a sport)
* “Let us join just another society”-kind of attitude
* "I want to learn coding/data". Thinks KOSS is a society which teaches members to code.
* Mentions “Google Summer of Code” as the primary reason to join KOSS
* Member of a society/club/fest with high involvement (ACell/KTJ/SF/E-Cell)

### Positive points

* Participated in KWoC or Summit
* Follows KOSS, already in touch with any of its members
* Tried tools/frameworks with a mindset to explore
* Passion
* Self-confidence

### Negative points

* Showing off grades in PDS or CG/SG
* Inability to express or communicate clearly
* Trying to flatter by talking against Competitive Programming or praising KOSS too much.
* Thinks lowly / of stuff like FrontEnd Designing or designing in general.

Note: Negative points differ from Red Flags. A Red Flag is too serious to consider. However, negative points do not indicate rejecting a candidate. The interviewers need to make extra effort in understand the interviewee. They may also require extra attention from the Executives/Advisors to align with our ideologies.

## FAQs

### Why do we hold selections in the spring semester?

JEE Students do not do serious programming before coming to KGP. Hence, we give them a semester to explore their interests as well as attend workshops/events in the Autumn semester.

## Can we recruit second-year students as well?

Yes, absolutely! A few of KOSS members joined in their second year. However, it should be done as early as possible (in their Autumn semester). We should not hire second year students in their spring semester because that would create a whole lot of difference in the batch, which soon would become Executives.

## What is the ideal number of students to recruit?

A batch with more than 15 people is hard to manage. Increasing the team size makes it difficult to have like-minded people in the entire team across all the batches. Also, we should not be doing anything which requires the involvement of more than 15 people in every batch.

### 2018

The selection still followed direct walk-in interviews. The interviews were conducted on two days. The number of people who showed up was large compared to the number of interviewers. The experience was tiring and very repetitive with people who did not align with our principles. It was then decided that we should not do direct walk-in interviews.
