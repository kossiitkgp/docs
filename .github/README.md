# KOSS Documentation

KOSS Documentation is meant to be read and followed by the members of KOSS. We keep the docs public because
 - We want every written line to be questioned and discussed regularly. More eyes help us achieve that.
 - We want to be as open as possible with our standards
 - We want to share our methods with sister organizations, if they need help.
