# KOSS Documentation

KOSS Documentation is meant to be read and followed by the members of KOSS. We keep the docs public because
 - We want every written line to be questioned and discussed regularly. More eyes help us achieve that.
 - We want to be as open as possible with our standards
 - We want to share our methods with sister organizations, if they need help.

**See [`https://kossiitkgp.org/docs/`](https://kossiitkgp.org/docs/) for the frontpage. Read [`/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)for making any change**
