### Poster Design Guidelines
#### Size
- For printable posters, the size must be **11.5x17.5 inches** to be printed properly without any borders and it must be in portrait orientation.
- Instagram restricts images in a post to **1:1 ratio**. A cropped or modified version of the poster may be required to post on Instagram but the print version should be prioritized.

#### Content
- The name "Kharagpur Open Source Society" or "KOSS" and a logo must be mentioned in a prominent position.
- Event posters:
	- Each poster must include a date, time, and location of the event.
	- Contact numbers of at least two people in-charge must be included on the poster.
- Posters that will be stuck on campus must include a QR code linking to a place where more information could be obtained or registration process could be done. The link could be to a website, a document, or a form.
- If the poster is about an event that has a sponsor, the poster must be first approved by the sponsor and must adhere to their brand guidelines.

### Poster Printing Guidelines
- Shops at IIT Kharagpur that print posters:
	- Quest Printers, Tech Market.
- The poster must be printed in A3 portrait size. See [#Size](#size).
- The poster must be readable, and the text must not be blurry. A sample should be printed and reviewed by other members before printing the final posters.
- An invoice must be generated in the name of "Kharagpur Open Source Society" for the posters printed.
