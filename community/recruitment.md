# Recruitment

## Whom do we recruit?
We recruit UG 1st years in the team, preferably after they have spent one semester on the campus. We can also recruit any 2nd year in their third semester, based on recommendations by the members.

## How do we recruit?
For more detailed description, refer [Freshers' Selection](/docs/events/freshers-selection)

## Do we accept M.Tech and Ph.D students?
No. By acceptance, we mean that they will hold a number of responsibilities
- Attend our meetings
- Participate in conducting our workshops and help with the required logistics
- Collaborate on projects together
- Be an active member of the society

However, we have been collaborating with non-KOSS members since forever. They are welcome to join/lead our events or pitch something to us. If they want to talk about something, we can have them in one of our meetings as well.
