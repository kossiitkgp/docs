## Why do we lay off some Core Team members? What are the reasons?

A bad influence justifies bad turn of events in the future. When they become an advisor, they will recruit similar kind of people. New Core Team Members will start following them. Hence, we can not be passive about the membership of a CTM. We have to make sure we purge any unwanted behavior in time. Hence, it is important that we keep the doors open until a CTM becomes an Executive.

1. If they do not align with our vision. Read [Founding Principles of KOSS](/docs/founding-principles).
1. If they often do not show up in Meetings, Slack, or E-mails.
1. If they never take ownership of KOSS.
  1. If they repeatatively do not care about how our meetings or events happen in their absense.
1. If they never take leadership of KOSS. If they never take any initiatives or never took part in any initiative by one of their batchmates.
  1. If they depend upon their batchmates all the time. If they never volunteer and take up any work by their own.
1. If they clearly feel or state that they do not belong here.

Note: One semester may not be enough to judge. Preferably do it after [Governance Review Week](/docs/community/governance-review-week).


## How do we classify a CTM as Executive Head and Executive Member?

The answer to this question should come from - the [Governance doc](/docs/community/governance).

After the Governance Review Week, all Executives and Advisors meet and decide for each CTM. Here are some guidelines -

1. Read the governance doc thoroughly and judge.
1. An Executive Head must be self-motivated about KOSS.
1. An Executive Head must be capable of leading a new batch of KOSS.
1. Think about all the new Executive Heads as a group. Their should not be any friction in it.
1. Do not select a scary low number of Heads. Keep it 3-6.
