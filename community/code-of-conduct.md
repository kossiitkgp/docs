# [Name Option 1] Workplace Harassment - Code of Conduct 
# [Name Option 2] An informal guide to avoid and deal with events of harassment and bullying
# [Name Option 3] Workplace Harassment - An informal guide

## Some basic fundamentals

1. Humans are flawed and make mistakes on a regular basis while discovering new ways to hurt new people.

2. We don't live in an ideal world, so we are not dealing with ideal scenarios.

3. But the above statement doesn't provide wind to the practicality argument. Practicality argument is an exceptionally dangerous proposition in itself. So any time any particular statement is backed up by "being practical", it should take care of few things :-
   1. Being practical means what can be done or is possible in some finite duration. So it should be aggressively progressive in nature and it shouldn't settle on "n" but "n + ∞". We can start from "n" but the vision should be clear to reach "n + ∞" as fast as possible.
   2. It should be “enabler” in nature.

4. Any democratic argument in case of harassment should be thrown out of the window immediately. For example, "9 out of 10 people are okay with this".

5. Humans are not rational, so don't expect them to behave rationally. We are totally full of feelings.

6. We don't accept snowflake argument. Some people have thick skin and are borderline stoic, and they think that "I am responsible for my feelings" and on the opposite end of emotional spectrum, are people who think that "You don't get to decide if you hurt someone". We will try to have an inclusive space for both of these people.

7. Humans hate to forgive people if forgiving is tough.

8. Convincing a human that they are wrong or have done wrong is exceptionally tough.

9. Humans have double standards. Deal with it.

## Basic Protocol in case you are harassed/bullied/found something offensive/weird/unacceptable

Subject -> Who has been harassed/bullied

Type 1 :- Constitutionally Legal Offense

1. In this case the team is requested not to micromanage. let it go through official channels of college and judiciary and let them deal with it.

Type 2 :- Everything Else

1. If it has happened for the first time, dm the person. And let {pronoun} know that this behaviour is offensive to the subject. If not comfortable confronting then **????????????? @team comments**
2. Post on a public forum that the subject finds this particular behaviour offensive/xyz. Name calling doesn't help.
3. If it's repetitive, **what to do ???????????????????? @team , comments**

## Basic Protocol in case you are accused of harassment/bullying/offending/doing weird shits/unacceptable behaviour

Subject -> Who has been accused

1. Well the subject can start by saying sorry, and ensuring that similar behaviour is not repeated in front of the person who has accused the subject "ever". If it's ingrained in the subject’s habit let the accussee know that, it's in your habit you will make sincere effort to decrease the frequency. The subject can take a note and share updates of progress {pronoun} have made on that person's feedback.
2. Adding "genuinely" prefix in front of sorry doesn't help.
3. It doesn't matter if the subject’s sorry or change is genuine or fake, as long as it's change it's good.

## Basic Protocol in case you have noticed harassment.

## Basic Protocol in case you are an executive/advisor and have to take action

## What is Considered as Sexual Harassment at Work Place ?

What workplace at koss includes, **@team ????????????**

Sexual harassment includes many things but is not limited to

[Ref](https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf)

1. Actual or attempted rape or sexual assault.
2. Unwanted pressure for sexual favors.
3. Unwanted deliberate touching, leaning over, cornering, or pinching.
4. Unwanted sexual looks or gestures.
5. Unwanted letters, telephone calls, or materials of a sexual nature.
6. Unwanted pressure for dates.
7. Unwanted sexual teasing, jokes, remarks, or questions.
8. Referring to an adult as a girl, hunk, doll, babe, or honey.
9. Whistling at someone.
10. Cat calls.
11. Sexual comments.
12. Turning work discussions to sexual topics.
13. Sexual innuendos or stories.
14. Asking about sexual fantasies, preferences, or history.
15. Personal questions about social or sexual life.
16. Sexual comments about a person's clothing, anatomy, or looks.
17. Kissing sounds, howling, and smacking lips.
18. Telling lies or spreading rumors about a person's personal sex life.
19. Neck massage.
20. Touching an employee's clothing, hair, or body.
21. Giving personal gifts., Hanging around a person.
22. Hugging, kissing, patting, or stroking.
23. Touching or rubbing oneself sexually around another person.
24. Standing close or brushing up against a person.
25. Looking a person up and down (elevator eyes).
26. Staring at someone.
27. Sexually suggestive signals.
28. Facial expressions, winking, throwing kisses, or licking lips.
29. Making sexual gestures with hands or through body movements.



The point of having this list, is to make people aware that these things can be considered offensive and harassment, by some people. We come from different culture, for example hugging might be quite common in a few culture, but might not be well received by some other culture. So asking “if a person is comfortable” might help in all verbal/non-verbal/physical contact.

## What is considered as bullying ?

[Ref](https://www.stopbullying.gov/bullying/what-is-bullying)

1. Verbal bullying, is saying or writing mean things. Verbal bullying includes:
   1. Teasing
   2. Name-calling
   3. Inappropriate sexual comments
   4. Taunting
   5. Threatening to cause harm

1. Social bullying, sometimes referred to as relational bullying, involves hurting someone’s reputation or relationships. Social bullying includes:

   1. Leaving someone out on purpose
   2. Telling other children not to be friends with someone
   3. Spreading rumors about someone
   4. Embarrassing someone in public

1. Physical bullying , involves hurting a person’s body or possessions. Physical bullying includes:

   1. Hitting/kicking/pinching
   2. Spitting
   3. Tripping/pushing
   4. Taking or breaking someone’s things
   5. Making mean or rude hand gestures

## Basic Ownership Model

Subject -> Who has been accused of harassment/bullying

The actor owns the action and it's consequence like hurting or acting as disabler. You shouldn't blame the affected person for being affected.

Having empathy and good will for the affected person is great, but the truth is :-

1. Just asking/demanding for a thicker skin won't magically generate a thicker skin.
2. Not every time humans have the energy and need to change.

So rather than expecting and introducing toxic culture for developing thicker skin, the subject is requested to just fucking change themselves temporarily/selectively. It might be general or it can be personalized, but change is necessary.

## Status Game

Try not to play status game by :-

1. Taking moral high ground.
2. Stating the documentation for proving that a person accused of harassment/bullying is wrong and the person proving it, is right.
3. Putting the other person in a box like, "is a snowflake" , "is an asshole" , "has double standards"

All of this doesn't solve anything apart from aloofing the person being boxed up.

## Nitpicking, Agenda and Bias

We all have some bias and personal agenda. Nothing wrong.

But we request the team members to keep their personal agenda/mission and bias to themselves and not let it seep in the public or private workspace of KOSS. Your behaviour in a KOSS workspace should be synonymous to what our organisation stands for. Not to exploit the organisation’s resources and connection to fulfill your personal missions/agenda good or bad. Try not to manipulate our Mission Statement to suit your own agenda, it’s simple, to spread open source”. Now a lot of thing can be indirectly done to spread open source, like distributing food to impoverished child, so that {pronoun} doesn’t die and later come and spread open source, or the below mentioned example, but the thing is there are a lot of things we can do directly to spread open source, that we are not doing, so let’s cover all of them first, then move to deeper and more indirect ways to spread open source.

Cons, if you follow the above statement line by line :- Classifying someways as direct and someways as indirect is itself filled with bias. Some seemingly indirect ways can bring more people to open source than seemingly direct ways. So the above statement should be taken as guideline, and not limit the team to experiment with new things. This guideline is just there to avoid unnecessary conflicts/misunderstanding/politicisation etc of our workspace and digress too much from our goal.

Nitpicking replies/comments/reactions based on based on team member’s  gender/sexual preferences/political opinions should be strictly avoided.

**Example :- A person with a mission to uplift and empower women technocrats can seem as intentional favouring to achieve and fulfill personal desires. Now thinking in this way, my intentions are good, so it doesn’t matter what other people think is not acceptable. It does matter and your actions affect the whole organisation. It’s a good cause, but the way and place might not be appropriate.**
