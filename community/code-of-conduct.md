# Workplace Harassment - An informal guide

## Some basic fundamentals

1. Humans are flawed and make mistakes on a regular basis.

2. We don't live in an ideal world, so we are not dealing with ideal scenarios.

3. But the above statement doesn't provide wind to the practicality argument. Practicality argument is an exceptionally dangerous proposition in itself. So any time any particular statement is backed up by "being practical", it should take care of few things :-
   1. Being practical means what can be done or is possible in some finite duration. So it should be aggressively progressive in nature and it shouldn't settle on "n" but "n + ∞". We can start from "n" but the vision should be clear to reach "n + ∞" as fast as possible.
   2. It should be “enabler” in nature.
   3. Example :- Just assume some company x is going to sponsor our events for which the whole team has put a lot of efforts, but during that time, a team member y came to know about few events of harassment, so a persuasive member might convince the team that, "it's not practical to reveal these events to public, let's bury it for now".

4. Any democratic argument in case of harassment should be thrown out of the window immediately. For example, "9 out of 10 people are okay with this".

5. We at times can be irrational due to circumstances sometimes in our control and sometimes beyond our control.

6. We don't accept snowflake argument. Some people have thick skin and are borderline stoic, and they think that "I am responsible for my feelings" and on the opposite end of emotional spectrum, are people who think that "You don't get to decide if you hurt someone". We will try to have an inclusive space for both of these people.

7. Humans hate to forgive people if forgiving is tough.

8. Convincing a human that they are wrong or have done wrong is exceptionally tough.

9. All decisions must always be taken wrt the current scenario. Disregarding someone's opinion because of past behavior is wrong. 

10. Adding "genuinely" prefix in front of sorry doesn't help.

## Basic Protocol in case you are harassed/bullied/found something offensive/weird/unacceptable

Subject -> Who has been harassed/bullied

Type 1 :- Constitutionally Legal Offense  

In case of sexual harassment, constitutional legal offense comprises of but is not limited to :-

1. physical contact and advances; or
2. a demand or request for a sexual favour; or
3. making sexually coloured remarks; or
4. showing pornography; or
5. any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature;
  
[Ref](https://www.indialegallive.com/special-story/the-legal-perspective-of-mental-harassment/)

1. In this case the team is requested not to micromanage. let it go through official channels of college and judiciary and let them deal with it.
2. Contact [ICC](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/internal-complaints-committee)

### Note  
Type 2 :- Everything Else

1. If it has happened for the first time, dm the person. And let {pronoun} know that this behaviour is offensive to the subject. If not comfortable confronting then talk to your 1:1 senior, or anyone whom you feel comfortable asking for advice. Do get advice from multiple trusted people before landing on a pathway of action.

2. Also, securing evidence of the harassment is important as it substantiates the claims made.

3. Post on a public forum that the subject finds this particular behaviour offensive/xyz. Name calling doesn't help.
4. If there are multiple incidents already, it is more than likely that this will repeat, therefore stricter measures are necessary.

## Basic Protocol in case you are accused of harassment/bullying/offending/unacceptable behaviour

Subject -> Who has been accused

1. Well the subject can start by saying sorry, and ensuring that similar behaviour is not repeated in front of the person who has accused the subject "ever". If it's ingrained in the subject’s habit let the accussee know that, it's in your habit you will make sincere effort to decrease the frequency. The subject can take a note and share updates of progress {pronoun} have made on that person's feedback.

2. It doesn't matter if the subject’s sorry or change is genuine or fake, as long as it's change for good it's good.

## Basic Protocol in case you have noticed harassment.


1. Inform other team members, see about their perspective if they have also witnessed the incident or any other incidents with same accused.
2. Ask the victim what they want to do about it. Refer to them this guide and let them take the appropriate decisions.
3. Care should be taken that the incident does not become a means to defame, harass, or trouble the accused until the incident is established and proven.
4. Proven in a lost sense that there are enough reasons established to conclude that the accused is guilty.



## Basic Protocol in case you are an executive/advisor and have to take action


1. If it's comes under legal offense, advise the victim to directly deal with the authorities and provide all the necessary support. Time is crucial in such cases and the sooner the matter is pursued for prosecution the better.

2. If it doesn't come under legal offense, Inform other team members, see about their perspective if they have also witnessed the incident or any other incidents with same accused. Make sure the discussion doesn't continue indefinitely.

3. Mediate the conversation between the victim and the accused. The accused may try gaslighting as a way out

4. The matter is over if :-
   1. It is a single incident and the accused is ready for amends
   2. The victim is fine with the amends and doesn't want to take this further
   3. Note - If the victim is not fine with the amends, ask them to suggest what will be fine. If a settlement is not reached, suggest the victim to make the accusation public, if it helps.

5. With majority approval of advisors and substantiated proof of the incident is enough to terminate the accused from KOSS. The reason of termination should be made public to stop rumors and misinformation.   

## What is Considered as Sexual Harassment at Work Place ?


### What workplace at koss includes :-

1. Slack workspace
2. A team outing (similar to an office party)
3. Events and Event meetups

### Note 1 
Members of KOSS can always support the victim on other platforms without any intervention from KOSS. However, they should not depict this as a support from the entire society unless anything of that nature is released from the page, the decision of which lies with the Execs and the Advisors.  

### Note 2
It may happen that A has raised concerns over remarks made by B outside of the KOSS workplace and which do not concern KOSS in anyway, but both A and B happen to be KOSS members, then it is not a situation where KOSS should intervene, I believe. Besides, we are not equipped in any way to deal with such situations.  

Sexual harassment includes many things but is not limited to

[Ref](https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf)

| Physical | Verbal | Non-Verbal |
|--------- | ------ | ---------  |
| Touching the person's clothing, hair, or body | Referring to an adult as a girl, hunk, doll, babe, or honey | Looking a person up and down (Elevator eyes) |
| Hugging, kissing, patting, or stroking | Whistling at someone, cat calls | Staring at someone |
| Touching or rubbing oneself sexually around another person | Making sexual comments about a person's body , innuendos , Turning work discussions to sexual topics | Blocking a person's path |
| Standing close or brushing up against another person | Telling sexual jokes or stories | Following the person |
| Actual or attempted rape or sexual assault | Asking personal questions about social or sexual life | Giving personal gifts |
| Unwanted deliberate touching, leaning over, cornering, or pinching | Making kissing sounds, howling, and smacking lips | Displaying sexually suggestive visuals | 
| | Making sexual comments about a person's clothing, anatomy, or looks | Making sexual gestures with hands or through body movements
| | Repeatedly asking out a person who is not interested | Making facial expressions such as winking, throwing kisses, or licking lips
| | Telling lies or spreading rumors about a person's personal sex life |
| | obscene calling/texting or objectionable messaging | |


The point of having this list, is to make people aware that these things can be considered offensive and harassment, by some people. We come from different culture, for example hugging might be quite common in a few culture, but might not be well received by some other culture. So asking “if a person is comfortable” might help in all verbal/non-verbal/physical contact.

## What is considered as bullying ?

[Ref](https://www.stopbullying.gov/bullying/what-is-bullying)

1. Verbal bullying, is saying or writing mean things. Verbal bullying includes:
   1. Teasing
   2. Name-calling
   3. Inappropriate sexual comments
   4. Taunting
   5. Threatening to cause harm

1. Social bullying, sometimes referred to as relational bullying, involves hurting someone’s reputation or relationships. Social bullying includes:

   1. Leaving someone out on purpose
   2. Telling other children not to be friends with someone
   3. Spreading rumors about someone
   4. Embarrassing someone in public

1. Physical bullying , involves hurting a person’s body or possessions. Physical bullying includes:

   1. Hitting/kicking/pinching
   2. Spitting
   3. Tripping/pushing
   4. Taking or breaking someone’s things
   5. Making mean or rude hand gestures

## Basic Ownership Model

Subject -> Who has been accused of harassment/bullying

The actor owns the action and it's consequence like hurting or acting as disabler. You shouldn't blame the affected person for being affected.

Having empathy and good will for the affected person is great, but the truth is :-

1. Just asking/demanding for a thicker skin won't magically generate a thicker skin.
2. Not every time humans have the energy and need to change.

So rather than expecting and introducing toxic culture for developing thicker skin, the subject is requested to just fucking change themselves temporarily/selectively. It might be general or it can be personalized, but change is necessary.

## Status Game

Try not to play status game by :-

1. Taking moral high ground.
2. Stating the documentation for proving that a person accused of harassment/bullying is wrong and the person proving it, is right.
3. Putting the other person in a box like, "is a snowflake" , "is an asshole" , "has double standards"

All of this doesn't solve anything apart from aloofing the person being boxed up.

## Nitpicking, Agenda and Bias

We all have some bias and personal agenda. Nothing wrong.

But we request the team members to keep their personal agenda/mission and bias to themselves and not let it seep in the public or private workspace of KOSS. Your behaviour in a KOSS workspace should be synonymous to what our organisation stands for. Not to exploit the organisation’s resources and connection to fulfill your personal missions/agenda good or bad. Try not to manipulate our Mission Statement to suit your own agenda, it’s simple, to spread open source”. Now a lot of thing can be indirectly done to spread open source, like distributing food to impoverished child, so that {pronoun} doesn’t die and later come and spread open source, or the below mentioned example, but the thing is there are a lot of things we can do directly to spread open source, that we are not doing, so let’s cover all of them first, then move to deeper and more indirect ways to spread open source.

Cons, if you follow the above statement line by line :- Classifying someways as direct and someways as indirect is itself filled with bias. Some seemingly indirect ways can bring more people to open source than seemingly direct ways. So the above statement should be taken as guideline, and not limit the team to experiment with new things. This guideline is just there to avoid unnecessary conflicts/misunderstanding/politicisation etc of our workspace and digress too much from our goal.

Nitpicking replies/comments/reactions based on team member’s  gender/sexual preferences/political opinions should be strictly avoided.

**Example :- A person with a mission to uplift and empower women technocrats can seem, as intentional favouring to achieve and fulfill personal desires. Now thinking in this way, my intentions are good, so it doesn’t matter what other people think about me, is not acceptable. It does matter and your actions affect the whole organisation. It’s a good cause, but the way and place might not be appropriate.**
