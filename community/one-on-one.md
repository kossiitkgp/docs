# 1:1

> Pronounced as *one on one*

During [Freshers' Induction](/docs/community/freshers-induction), every [Core Team Member](/docs/community/governance) is assigned one (or more) Executive(s) as 1:1 mentor(s). The mentee and mentor(s) decide the frequency, length, time, venue and nature of their 1:1 meetups.

A 1:1 can be about
* Career goals of Mentor/Mentee
* Feedback/Discussion about involvement in KOSS
* Brainstorming on new ideas/articles and implementations
* Creating a comfort zone for new members to open up with the team

## Notes
* Use Calendar to schedule your 1:1. Use the weekly/bi-weekly/monthly schedule feature.
* Come prepared with questions to ask or points to discuss. You can create an email thread between you and your mentor and log notes after the meetups.
* 1:1 mentorship is voluntary. Every Executive does not need to be a mentor if they are unable to commit their time.
* Mentors can invite any Advisor in any meeting. 1:1s are informal and inclusive.
* Mentors can be changed upon request by either the mentor or the mentee.

## Guidelines for the mentors
* Make sure your mentee feels comfortable.
* Let the mentee know that 1:1s are about them.
* Do not repeatedly cancel scheduled 1:1s. You may be creating a lot of impact on someone's KGP journey by taking 30 minutes out of your week.
* Some questions to ask your mentee are
  * How are you feeling?
  * What is on your mind?
  * What are you most excited about?
  * What are you most worried about?
  * Is there anything we should start doing as a team?
  * How do you want our 1:1s to go? Do you have any preferences?

## Guidelines for the mentees
* The meetups are about you. Be comfortable and use your mentor(s) as resources to discuss anything you wish.
* Some questions to ask your mentor(s) are
  * What do you think about my involvement in KOSS? How can I improve upon it?
  * Have you ever been in situation X? How did you solve it?
  * I am working on X these days. Do you have any suggestions or feedback?
  * I am thinking about learning X. Can you tell me the pros/cons of doing so?
  * Tell me something about yourself which I might not know.
