### Post Release Guidelines
- Try to include a poster in every post. **NOTE: Instagram posts cannot be shared without an image.**
- Long links should be shortened using a tool such as https://bit.ly.
    - Instagram posts do not allow links. The link should be added to the bio and in a comment instead, and this should be mentioned in the post.
- A short and **to-the-point** post and poster should be shared on Whatsapp groups and statuses.
- Twitter guidelines:
    - The number of words in a tweet is limited, so the post may have to be split into paragraphs and posted in a thread.
    - The post content must be shortened to include only the most essential information.
    - Try to include the most relevant information in the main tweet.
    - A poster, if present, must only be added to the main tweet of the thread.

### Resharing/Reposting Guidelines
- Posts from organizations such as MetaKGP that align with the views of KOSS or relevant posts from other KOSS members can be reshared/reposted from KOSS social media accounts.
- Each reshare suggestion **must** be discussed with other team members on Slack before posting it on any platform. The suggestion must be approved by at least *one executive and one advisor*.
- The repost must link back to the original post.
- Platform wise Guidelines:
    - On Facebook:
        - "Share to Feed": Share with a caption.
        - "Share Now": Share without a caption.
    - On Twitter:
        - "Quote": Share the original tweet with a caption.
        - "Repost": Share without a caption otherwise.
    - On LinkedIn:
        - "Repost with your thoughts": Share the post with a caption.
        - "Repost": Share without a caption.
    - On Instagram:
        - "Story": Generally, posts should be added to the story.
        - "Collaborative Post": In rare cases, a collaborative post can be released if approved internally, and the other organization agrees. (See [Instagram documentation](https://help.instagram.com/5861247717337470/?cms_platform=iphone-app&helpref=platform_switcher))
