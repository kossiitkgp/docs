Guidelines regarding how to handle, release posts, and transfer accessing of the official KOSS social media accounts.

### List of Socials
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kossiitkgp/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kossiitkgp)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kharagpur-open-source-society)

### Post Release Guidelines
- Try to include a poster in every post. **NOTE: Instagram posts must include a poster.**
- Long links should be shortened using a tool such as https://bit.ly.
	- Instagram posts do not allow links. The link should be added to the bio instead and this should be mentioned in the post.
- A shortened version of the post along with the poster should be shared on Whatsapp groups and statuses.
- Twitter Guidelines:
	- The number of words in a tweet is limited and hence the post must be split into paragraphs and a thread must be created.
	- The post content must be shortened to include only the most essential information.
	- Try to include as much information as possible in the main tweet.
	- A poster, if present, must only be added to the main tweet of the thread.

### Resharing/Reposting Guidelines
- Posts from organizations such as MetaKGP that align with the views of KOSS or relevant posts from other KOSS members can be reshared/reposted from KOSS social media accounts.
- These posts must align with KOSS's ideologies and must be relevant to what KOSS does or to open source.
- Each reshare suggestion **must** be discussed with other team members on Slack before posting it on any platform. The suggestion must be approved by at least one executive and one advisor.
- The repost must link back to the original post.
- Platformwise Guidelines:
	- On Facebook, the post must be shared using the share feature and with a caption if needed.
	- On Twitter, the tweet must be quoted.
	- On LinkedIn, the repost feature must be used. If a caption is to be added, use the "Repost with your thoughts" feature.
	- On Instagram, the post must be added to the story. In rare cases, a collaborative post can be released if it is approved internally and the other organization agrees to do so.

### Direct Message and Comment Reply Guidelines
- Simple queries can be replied to directly.
- Suggestions and other questions which may require discussion should be posted on Slack and discussed with executives and advisors.
