### Post Release Guidelines
- Try to include a poster in every post. **NOTE: Instagram posts cannot be shared without an image.**
- Long links should be shortened using a tool such as https://bit.ly.
    - Instagram posts do not allow links. The link should be added to the bio and in a comment instead, and this should be mentioned in the post.
- A shortened post and poster should be shared on Whatsapp groups and statuses.
- Twitter Guidelines:
    - The number of words in a tweet is limited, so the post must be split into paragraphs, and a thread must be created.
    - The post content must be shortened to include only the most essential information.
    - Try to include as much information as possible in the main tweet.
    - A poster, if present, must only be added to the main tweet of the thread.

### Resharing/Reposting Guidelines
- Posts from organizations such as MetaKGP that align with the views of KOSS or relevant posts from other KOSS members can be reshared/reposted from KOSS social media accounts.
- These posts must align with KOSS's ideologies and be relevant to what KOSS does or open source.
- Each reshare suggestion **must** be discussed with other team members on Slack before posting it on any platform. The suggestion must be approved by at least one executive and one advisor.
- The repost must link back to the original post.
- Platform wise Guidelines:
    - On Facebook, the post should be shared using the "Share Now" feature or using the "Share to Feed" if a caption is to be added, use the feature.
    - On Twitter, the original tweet should be shared using the "Repost" feature or using quoted if a caption is to be added.
    - On LinkedIn, the repost feature should be used. If a caption is to be added, use the "Repost with your thoughts" feature.
    - On Instagram, the post should be added to the story. In rare cases, a collaborative post can be released if approved internally, and the other organization agrees.

### Direct Message and Comment Reply Guidelines
- One executive should be assigned to each social media platform to read comments under posts and direct messages at least once a day and reply.
- Simple queries can be replied to directly.
- Suggestions and other questions which may require discussion should be posted on Slack and discussed with executives and advisors.
