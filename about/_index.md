# About

We are a bunch of Open Source Enthusiasts who focus on
something more preliminary and relevant in today's world, **"A Love for Coding"**.
Kharagpur Open Source Society tries to spread the culture of Open Sourcing among the students of IIT Kharagpur.
Every year KOSS plans to hold events for familiarizing students
with UNIX tools, Linux environment, Algorithms and Data Structures, 
and  Git Development Workflow besides conducting workshops
on GUI programming, Web development, Android application Development and Hackathons.
The major events we conduct are Kharagpur Winter of Code and the Open Source Summit.

KOSS works under the guidance of Prof. Animesh Mukherjee,
Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.
